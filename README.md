# Slim meets Aura.Input form

Lots of love for Slimframework. And there are some awesome components
of aura which have never seen much lights.

This repo is to show how you can integrate `aura/input` and `aura/html`
to create beautiful forms. [You can read the blog post here](http://harikt.com/blog/2014/09/02/aura-input-form-inside-slim-framework/)
